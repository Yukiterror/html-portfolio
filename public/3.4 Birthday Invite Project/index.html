<h3><b> <u>Here is a poem to lighten up the Mood:</u></b></h3>



  



<blockquote> <strong>
  The day returns again, my natal day;
What mix’d emotions with the Thought arise!
Beloved friend, four years have pass’d away
Since thou wert snatch’d forever from our eyes. –

The day, commemorative of my birth
Bestowing Life and Light and Hope on me,
Brings back the hour which was thy last on Earth.
Oh! bitter pang of torturing Memory! –
</strong></blockquote>
